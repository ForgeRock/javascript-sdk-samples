# Sample Apps

The samples use environment variables to populate your specific settings, such as OpenAM URL, OAuth 2.0 client ID, etc.

Start by making a copy of `.env.example` named `.env` and replacing the example settings to match your environment. When you build the apps using the provided `npm` scripts, your custom settings will replace placeholder values in the compiled versions.
